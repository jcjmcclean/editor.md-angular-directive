# editor.md-angular-directive
Hey! So you think editor.md is super swanky and want to use it in your angular project? Oh but it's a total pain to get it working, you need to initiate each instance with a unique id attribute and just how are you going to use ng-model? Well don't worry, here's a directive you can use which just works :-)

Feel free to take this, tear it apart and build it back up again.

You can see a working Plunker here for an example https://plnkr.co/edit/bhIIKOB029KaSpSolK2T
